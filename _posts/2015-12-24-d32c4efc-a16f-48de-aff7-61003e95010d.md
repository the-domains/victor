Victor Vroegindeweij is a documentary film director from The Netherlands. He specialises in documentary film and television and reality based commercials and content.

His award winning productions include feature films, television and commercial films. He focusses on the 'human experience' and is interested in the strategies people create to deal with the 'problem of life'. He believes that all human activity, whether it's our work or family, our career or our obsessions for food, our love for art or the relentless pursuit of happiness, they are all strategies we develop to forget that life is senseless and that we are all mortal.
